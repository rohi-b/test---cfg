                  <h4>A good source of antioxidants</h4>
                  <p>
                    Raw honey contains an array of plant chemicals that act as antioxidants. Antioxidants help to protect your body from cell damage due to free radicals which contribute to the aging and may contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease.

                  <h4>Heal wounds</h4>
                  <p>
                    Manuka honey is used in medical settings to treat wounds because itâ€™s been found to be an effective germ killer and can boost healing time and reduce infection.

                  <h4>Are there any risks?</h4>
                  <p>
                    In addition to beneficial prebiotics and nutrients, raw honey can also carry harmful bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum. This is particularly dangerous for babies. Raw honey should never be given to an infant less than a year old.
                        Symptoms of botulism poisoning in infants may include:
                        constipation
                        slow breathing
                        loss of head control
                        paralysis that spreads downward
                        poor feeding
                        lethargy
                        weak cry
                        In adults, symptoms can include an initial short period of diarrhea and vomiting, followed by constipation and more severe symptoms, such as blurred vision and muscle weakness. See a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms after eating raw honey.
