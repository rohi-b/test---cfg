                  <h4>Nurtritional Benefits</h4>
                  <p>
                    <li> Bananas are an excellent source of potassium and supply vitamin B6, fibre and carbohydrate, and some vitamin C.</li>
                    <li>Unripe bananas have a higher starch content. As they ripen, the starch is converted to sugar (and the fruit becomes sweeter).</li>
                    <li>Green bananas are also a good source of pectin, which is a type of dietary fibre found in fruits and helps them keep their structural form. Pectin breaks down when a banana becomes overripe, which causes the fruit to become softer.</li>

                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <h4>Health Benefits</h4>
                  <p>
                    <li>Bananas are loaded with valuable micronutrients, especially potassium. Potassium is one of the most important electrolytes in the body, helping to regulate heart function as well as fluid balance – a key factor in regulating blood pressure. </li>
                    <li>Bananas are soothing to the gastrointestinal tract due to their high content of pectin – as soluble fibre that not only lowers cholesterol but normalises bowel function.</li>
                    <li>The resistant starch in bananas also has a prebiotic effect, helping to fuel the gut bacteria so they increase their production of short chain fatty acids which are beneficial for digestive health.</li>
                  </p>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <h4>Fun Fact</h4>
                  <p>
                    <li>The inside of a banana skin can be used to calm an itchy mosquito bite - many people find that rubbing the bite with the skin helps to reduce irritation.</li>
                  </p>
